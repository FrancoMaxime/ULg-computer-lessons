# Code is writing
- Copyright applies like any artistic creation
- Copyright is immediate (you only have to prove the creation time unlike patents and trademarks)

---
class: center, middle

# Patents
- No software patents in EU
- In theory…

- Abstract ideas and algorithms are, in theory, unprotectable
- Programming languages are not protectable
- UX is a graphical creation

#Who's the author?

- Agreement between contributors, each is author of his/her lines
- Economic rights are usually transferred to the employer
- Authors keep their moral rights
- Diffusion under a given license is an economic right


???
One of the moral right is that each contributor have the right to see his name listed amongst the contributors.

#When there's no employer?
- Open Source projects usually have Contributor Agreements
- Not really needed when there's no doubt about the intention of the contributor

???
For big projects, every contributor must sign a contributor agreement

#License

"A license is a contract between the provider of the software and the user"
???
The provider is not the author but the one who have the economic right. In many cases, that is the employer.

class: center, middle

#Each software could have its own license
- But standardisation helps to clarify the use
- Software distributors are not lawyers
- A license might be illegal and thus invalid (hence the test in court)

???
If a license is tested as invalid in court, nobody can enforces it anymore

#Free Software vs proprietary software

???
The difference is arbitrary but is only related to the license.

---
class: center, middle

#How to license a software?

???
Answer : you have to make sure that the user was informed of the license and could read it. That's why you often have those "I agree" boxes.

#Copyleft

Copyleft = cannot restrict the rights on a software that is modified or redistributed

#Tivo and Tivoisation
- GPL version 3
- GPL v2+

???
Tivo was a television recorder using a modified linux in 2006. Source were distributed but a chip only allowed the orignial code to run. Thus, you could not run any modification of the code. Linus Torvalds doesn't care while, for stallman, this was unacceptable. GPLv3 prevents that.
2+ means that any subsequent version is accepted

#LGPL
Weak Copyleft

???
Use of a free library (w/o modifying it) in a proprietary software is permitted

Not commercial is not very well formulated: at which point is it commercial or not?

Share-alike = copyleft

#Dual licensing

???
It is possible for code to be under two licenses
---
class: center, middle

#StarOffice, OpenOffice

???
LGPL and Sun Industry Standards Source License. StarOffice was proprietary and for internal use and OpenOffice was free and for distribution. So when code was pushed, it was pushed into the two projects.

LibreOffice : LGPL and MPL

That's why some people refuse to sign contributor agreements.
